What is TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform
for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools,
libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-
the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered
applications. Learn more about TensorFlow from here.

We will be using Google Colab for this demo. Google Colab is a free cloud
service which can be used to develop deep learning applications using
popular libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV. To know

Let�s jump straight to a sample problem we are going to solve using
TensorFlow and Machine-Learning concepts.

Let�s assume that we are given the marketing budget spent (in thousands of
dollars) by a media-services provider in the last 8 months along with the
number of new subscribers (also in thousands) for the same time in the
table given below:
